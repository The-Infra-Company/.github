# The Infra Company

This repository fulfills unique functions for The Infra Company Github Organization.

1. It can contain special org-level files that provide functionality for our organization on GitHub. These files include:
    - **[`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md)** - the profile README for the Cloud Posse GitHub organization
    - **[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** - our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities
2. It can also act as a source for defaults of some repo-level files that might be found in a new GitHub repo's `.github` folder. 
   In the event that a new repo is initialized without these files, the repo will behave on github.com as if the default copies of these files were present in the repo. 
   These files include:
    - **[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS)** - governs required approvals for pull requests
    - **[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)** - issue templates for the project
    - **[`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)** - pull request template for the project
